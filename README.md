# Matheus Cardoso

Founding Engineer at Raiku, building high-performance infrastructure for Solana.
I work across the core protocol stack, from off-chain transaction processing to
validator modifications, with a focus on low latency, high throughput, and
production-grade observability.

## Focus

- Rust + Tokio systems engineering
- Networking and validator-level performance work
- Reliable, deployable infrastructure for node operators

## Highlights

- Built and optimized Solana infrastructure handling 60,000+ TPS
- Improved zkVM internals and observability at RISC Zero; contributed to Bonsai
- Shipped a high-throughput Ethereum relayer (millions of tx/day)
- Built a derivatives exchange at Composable Finance (~$21M TVL)

## Background

Former bioinformatics researcher at the University of Brasilia (protein folding,
genomic pipelines). I now apply that same rigor to distributed systems and
cryptographic infrastructure.
