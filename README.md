# Matheus Cardoso

Systems engineer focused on high-performance blockchain infrastructure and
distributed systems. I build core protocol components, from off-chain
transaction processing to validator-level performance work, with a focus on low
latency, high throughput, and production-grade observability.

## Focus

- Rust + Tokio systems engineering
- Networking and validator-level performance work
- Reliable, deployable infrastructure for node operators

## Highlights

- Built and optimized Solana infrastructure handling 60,000+ TPS
- Improved zkVM internals and observability at RISC Zero; contributed to Bonsai
- Shipped a high-throughput Ethereum relayer (millions of tx/day)
- Built a derivatives exchange at Composable Finance (~$21M TVL)

## Background

Former bioinformatics researcher at the University of Brasilia (protein folding,
genomic pipelines). I now apply that same rigor to distributed systems and
cryptographic infrastructure.
